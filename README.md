# Password Generator

## Overview

This project creates a randomly generated password of the users choosing. Users can select the requirements for the password including length, numbers, lower case letters, upper case letters, and special characters by answering prompts/confirms to choose parameters. Users will click the "Generate Password" button, which gives the user several prompts/confirms listed above, which will generate their random password using those answers, and display it in the text area. 

The password generator uses JavaScript as the primary language to create and run functions that will take users' requirements and modify the elements on the HTML file. The password is created using the random math functions, for loops, prompts/confirms, if/else statements, dev created functions, and runs using eventListeners.

Users can utilize this tool to quickly create secure passwords while creating accounts, updating old passwords, or adding a level of security they may not have had otherwise.
